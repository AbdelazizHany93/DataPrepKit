# Project Description
In the DataPrepKit capstone project, students will embark on developing a Python package named "DataPrepKit." This package aims to be a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing datasets. Utilizing their knowledge in NumPy and Pandas, students will create a series of functions that assist in reading data from a variety of file formats, summarizing datasets, managing missing values, and encoding categorical data. The ultimate goal of this project is to publish the DataPrepKit package on PyPI, thereby making it available to the wider Python community.




# Project Requirements:
-Proficient use of NumPy and Pandas for data analysis and manipulation.
-Robust function implementation for data reading, summary generation, missing value handling, and categorical data encoding.


# Evaluation Criteria:
-Functionality and correctness of the data preprocessing features implemented.
-Quality and completeness of the documentation provided.
-Effectiveness of the test suite in ensuring the package's reliability.
-Adherence to best practices in coding, packaging, and testing.
-Creativity and efficiency in managing different file formats and data preprocessing challenges.
