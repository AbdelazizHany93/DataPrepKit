# Project Description
In the DataPrepKit capstone project, I will embark on developing a Python package named "DataPrepKit." This package aims to be a comprehensive toolkit for preprocessing datasets. Utilizing my knowledge in NumPy and Pandas, I will create a series of functions that assist in reading data from a variety of file formats, summarizing datasets, managing missing values, and encoding categorical data.



# Project Requirements:
-Proficient use of NumPy and Pandas for data analysis and manipulation.
-Robust function implementation for data reading, summary generation, missing value handling, and categorical data encoding.


# Evaluation Criteria:
-Functionality and correctness of the data preprocessing features implemented.
-Quality and completeness of the documentation provided.
-Effectiveness of the test suite in ensuring the package's reliability.
-Adherence to best practices in coding, packaging, and testing.
-Creativity and efficiency in managing different file formats and data preprocessing challenges.
